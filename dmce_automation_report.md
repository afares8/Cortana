# DMCE Portal Automation Report

## Summary
This report documents the results of automating the DMCE portal login and invoice automation process using Playwright with Firefox in private browsing mode. The script successfully logs in to the portal but encounters challenges with finding and accessing the invoice functionality.

## Test Environment
- **Browser**: Firefox in private browsing mode
- **Credentials**: crandonzlpr / perfumes
- **Framework**: Playwright with stealth capabilities
- **Execution**: Headless execution via xvfb-run

## Successful Components
1. **Login Process**: 
   - Successfully navigates to the login page
   - Opens the login popup
   - Extracts hidden form fields
   - Submits credentials programmatically
   - Verifies successful login

2. **Dashboard Loading**:
   - Successfully loads the dashboard after login
   - Handles popup windows
   - Implements multiple waiting strategies for dashboard loading

## Challenges Encountered
1. **Invoice Functionality Access**:
   - Unable to find invoice-related elements in the dashboard
   - All tested potential invoice URLs returned 404 errors
   - No invoice-related menu items found in the dashboard

2. **Dashboard Structure**:
   - Dashboard uses SmartClient framework (ISC modules)
   - Contains 2 iframes which likely host the application content
   - Complex loading mechanism with hidden body element

## Evidence Collected
1. **Videos**: 18 WebM recordings capturing the entire automation process
2. **Screenshots**: 11 PNG images showing key steps and error states
3. **Logs**: 9 log files including console output and HTML content
4. **Trace**: Playwright trace.zip file for detailed debugging

## Technical Insights
1. **Login Process**:
   - Requires handling hidden form fields: language, _csrf, j_f, j_s, j_nath
   - Post-login URL: https://dmce2.zonalibredecolon.gob.pa/TFBFTZ/TFB.jsp?language=es

2. **Dashboard Behavior**:
   - Uses SmartClient framework with dynamic content loading
   - Multiple IDACall AJAX requests to load dashboard components
   - Body element remains hidden during loading process

3. **Invoice URL Testing**:
   - All tested URL patterns returned 404 errors:
     - /TFBFTZ/factura/list.cl?language=es
     - /TFBFTZ/invoice/list.cl?language=es
     - /TFBFTZ/facturas/list.cl?language=es
     - /TFBFTZ/invoices/list.cl?language=es
     - /TFBFTZ/dmce/list.cl?language=es
     - /TFBFTZ/dmce/factura.cl?language=es

## Recommendations
1. **Manual Exploration**:
   - Log in to the DMCE portal manually
   - Use browser DevTools to analyze network requests
   - Identify the correct navigation path to invoice functionality
   - Document the exact URL and selectors for invoice list and automation buttons

2. **Script Enhancements**:
   - Update the script with the correct invoice URL and selectors
   - Implement more robust iframe handling
   - Add support for SmartClient-specific interactions
   - Consider recording a manual navigation sequence for replay

3. **Alternative Approaches**:
   - The invoice functionality might be accessible only through UI navigation
   - Consider implementing a step-by-step navigation approach
   - Explore SmartClient-specific API calls that might provide direct access

## Next Steps
1. Perform manual exploration to identify the correct invoice URL and selectors
2. Update the automation script with the findings
3. Implement more robust handling of SmartClient components
4. Test the updated script with the correct navigation path

# DMCE Portal Automation Final Report

## Executive Summary
We've successfully implemented and tested automation for the DMCE portal login process using Playwright with Firefox in private browsing mode. The script successfully logs in but cannot locate the invoice functionality due to the complex dashboard structure and lack of direct URL access to invoice pages.

## Test Results

### Successful Components
1. **Environment Setup**: ✅
   - Node.js with Playwright installed
   - Firefox browser configured for private browsing
   - Stealth plugins implemented

2. **Login Process**: ✅
   - Successfully navigates to login page
   - Opens login popup
   - Extracts hidden form fields
   - Submits credentials programmatically
   - Verifies successful login

3. **Dashboard Loading**: ✅
   - Successfully loads dashboard after login
   - Handles popup windows
   - Implements multiple waiting strategies

### Unsuccessful Components
1. **Invoice Functionality**: ❌
   - Unable to locate invoice-related elements in dashboard
   - All tested invoice URLs returned 404 errors
   - No direct path to invoice automation discovered

## Technical Details

### Login Process
- **Initial URL**: https://dmce2.zonalibredecolon.gob.pa/TFBFTZ/cusLogin/login.cl?language=es
- **Post-login URL**: https://dmce2.zonalibredecolon.gob.pa/TFBFTZ/TFB.jsp?language=es
- **Hidden Form Fields**: language, _csrf, j_f, j_s, j_nath
- **Credentials Used**: crandonzlpr / perfumes

### Dashboard Structure
- Uses SmartClient framework (ISC modules)
- Contains 2 iframes which likely host application content
- Complex loading mechanism with hidden body element
- Multiple IDACall AJAX requests to load dashboard components

### Attempted Invoice URLs (All 404)
- /TFBFTZ/factura/list.cl?language=es
- /TFBFTZ/invoice/list.cl?language=es
- /TFBFTZ/facturas/list.cl?language=es
- /TFBFTZ/invoices/list.cl?language=es
- /TFBFTZ/dmce/list.cl?language=es
- /TFBFTZ/dmce/factura.cl?language=es

## Recommendations

### Manual Exploration Required
Based on our findings, we recommend:

1. **Manual Navigation Mapping**:
   - Log in to the DMCE portal manually
   - Use browser DevTools to record network requests
   - Document the exact navigation path to invoice functionality
   - Identify the correct URL and selectors for invoice list

2. **Script Updates**:
   - Update the automation script with the correct navigation path
   - Implement SmartClient-specific interactions if needed
   - Add support for menu navigation rather than direct URL access

3. **Alternative Approach**:
   - Consider implementing a step-by-step UI navigation approach
   - Record a manual navigation sequence for replay
   - Explore SmartClient API calls that might provide direct access

## Next Steps
To complete the automation:

1. Perform manual exploration to map the exact navigation path
2. Update the script with the correct navigation sequence
3. Implement robust error handling for each navigation step
4. Test the updated script with real invoice data

## Conclusion
The current implementation successfully handles the login process but requires additional manual exploration to discover the correct path to invoice functionality. The complex dashboard structure using SmartClient framework makes automated discovery challenging, but with manual mapping, the automation can be completed successfully.

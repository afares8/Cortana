# DMCE Portal Invoice URL Exploration Report

## Summary of Findings
After extensive exploration of the DMCE portal, we have determined that:

1. The invoice functionality is not accessible through direct URL patterns we tested
2. The dashboard contains 2 iframes which likely host the application content
3. The SmartClient framework used by the portal makes automated exploration challenging
4. The dashboard has a complex loading mechanism that requires special handling

## Exploration Methods Attempted
1. **Direct URL Testing**: All tested URL patterns returned 404 errors
2. **Dashboard UI Exploration**: Found 2 iframes but encountered technical limitations
3. **Menu Item Analysis**: No obvious invoice-related menu items were found

## Technical Insights
1. The dashboard URL is: https://dmce2.zonalibredecolon.gob.pa/TFBFTZ/TFB.jsp?language=es
2. The dashboard uses SmartClient framework (ISC) which:
   - Loads content dynamically through AJAX calls
   - Uses iframes to isolate application components
   - Makes extensive use of IDACall endpoints for data retrieval

## Recommended Manual Approach
Since automated exploration has limitations, we recommend the following manual approach:

1. **Manual Browser Exploration**:
   - Log in to the DMCE portal with the provided credentials
   - Open browser DevTools (F12) and go to the Network tab
   - Clear the network log and enable "Preserve log"
   - Explore the dashboard UI manually, clicking on menu items and navigation elements
   - Look for any menu items related to "Factura", "Invoice", or "DMCE"
   - When you find and navigate to the invoice section, note the URL and network requests

2. **Network Request Analysis**:
   - In the Network tab, filter for XHR/Fetch requests
   - Look for requests to endpoints containing "factura", "invoice", or "dmce"
   - Pay attention to IDACall requests which might contain invoice data
   - Identify the specific request that loads invoice data

3. **UI Element Inspection**:
   - Use the Elements tab to inspect the invoice list container
   - Note the HTML structure, particularly table elements and their selectors
   - Identify selectors for invoice rows, automation buttons, and status indicators

## Implementation Strategy
Once the correct URL and selectors are identified manually, update the automation script with:

1. The exact URL for the invoice functionality
2. The correct selectors for the invoice list container and rows
3. The appropriate waiting strategy for the dashboard and invoice page
4. The correct method to trigger invoice automation

## Next Steps
1. Perform manual exploration as described above
2. Document the correct URL and selectors
3. Update the automation script with the findings
4. Test the updated script to verify it can access the invoice functionality

This approach will ensure we have the correct information needed to successfully automate the invoice process in the DMCE portal.

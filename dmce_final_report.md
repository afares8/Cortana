# DMCE Portal Automation - Final Report

## Overview

This report documents the results of testing the DMCE portal automation script with Firefox in private browsing mode. The script was designed to automate the complete DMCE declaration process, from login to PDF download.

## Test Environment

- **Date:** May 7, 2025
- **Operating System:** Ubuntu with xvfb
- **Browser:** Firefox in Private Mode
- **Credentials:** crandonzlpr/perfumes
- **Test Data:** Sample invoice and declaration data

## Test Results Summary

| Process Stage | Status | Details |
|--------------|--------|---------|
| Environment Setup | ✅ Success | Node.js and Playwright successfully installed |
| Credential Configuration | ✅ Success | Credentials loaded from environment variables |
| Browser Launch | ✅ Success | Firefox launched in private browsing mode |
| Login Process | ✅ Success | Successfully authenticated with provided credentials |
| Dashboard Navigation | ✅ Success | Successfully loaded dashboard |
| Menu Navigation | ⚠️ Partial | Required JavaScript evaluation and coordinate clicks |
| Form Loading | ⚠️ Partial | Found form but with different selector than expected |
| Section A Form Filling | ❌ Failed | Timeout when trying to locate form fields |
| Sections B-E | ❌ Not Tested | Could not proceed due to Section A failure |
| Form Submission | ❌ Not Tested | Could not proceed due to form submission failure |
| PDF Download | ❌ Not Tested | Could not proceed due to form submission failure |
| Logout | ❌ Not Tested | Could not proceed due to previous failures |

## Detailed Process Flow

### 1. Login Process
- Successfully navigated to the DMCE login page
- Successfully opened login popup
- Successfully extracted hidden form fields
- Successfully submitted credentials
- Successfully authenticated and navigated to dashboard

### 2. Dashboard Navigation
- Successfully loaded dashboard after login
- Required multiple retry attempts with increased timeouts
- Successfully captured screenshots of dashboard state

### 3. Menu Navigation
- Standard selectors for menu items not working
- Successfully used JavaScript evaluation to click on "Declaración" menu
- Required coordinate clicks as fallback for "Crear Declaración" submenu
- Successfully navigated to declaration form page

### 4. Form Loading
- Expected selector #crearDeclaracionForm not found
- Successfully found generic form element as fallback
- Successfully captured screenshot of form state

### 5. Form Filling Attempts
- Timeout when trying to locate #inputFactura for Invoice ID
- Timeout when trying to locate #inputFechaDeclaracion for Declaration Date
- Timeout when trying to locate #inputCliente for Customer Code
- Could not proceed with remaining form sections

## Technical Issues Encountered

### 1. Selector Mismatches
The primary issue encountered was selector mismatches. The expected selectors (#inputFactura, #inputFechaDeclaracion, #inputCliente) were not found in the form. This suggests that either:
- The form structure has changed since the script was written
- The form is loaded within an iframe that needs to be accessed first
- The form uses dynamically generated IDs that change between sessions

### 2. Navigation Challenges
The dashboard navigation required JavaScript evaluation and coordinate clicks because standard selectors were not working. This suggests that:
- The dashboard uses complex JavaScript frameworks that make standard selectors unreliable
- The menu items might be within iframes or shadow DOM elements
- The application might have anti-automation measures in place

### 3. Timing Issues
Multiple timeouts were encountered during the test, suggesting that:
- The application has variable load times that require adaptive timeouts
- Network latency affects the responsiveness of the application
- The application might be throttling automated requests

## Evidence Collected

All evidence has been packaged into `dmce_automation_evidence.tar.gz` and includes:

### Screenshots
- Initial login page
- Login popup
- Post-login dashboard
- Dashboard loading retries
- Declaration menu navigation
- Declaration form
- Error states for each form field

### Videos
- Complete recording of the automation process
- Multiple video segments covering different stages of the process

### Logs
- Full console output with request/response details
- Error messages and stack traces
- Navigation attempts and fallback strategies

### Trace
- Complete Playwright trace file for detailed debugging
- Includes network requests, DOM snapshots, and action history

## Recommendations for Improvement

### 1. Update Selectors
- Analyze the form structure in the collected screenshots
- Use browser DevTools to identify the correct selectors for form fields
- Implement more robust selector strategies (XPath, CSS selectors, text content)

### 2. Enhance Navigation Strategy
- Implement iframe traversal to access elements within nested frames
- Add shadow DOM penetration for complex UI frameworks
- Use more robust coordinate-based fallbacks with visual verification

### 3. Improve Error Handling
- Implement more granular retry mechanisms for each step
- Add adaptive timeouts based on application responsiveness
- Capture more detailed DOM structure for debugging selector issues

### 4. Optimize Authentication
- Implement direct form submission instead of UI interaction
- Extract and utilize all hidden form fields for proper authentication
- Add session cookie preservation for more reliable authentication

## Next Steps

1. **Selector Analysis:** Analyze the form structure in the collected screenshots to identify the correct selectors for form fields.

2. **Script Updates:** Update the script with the correct selectors and enhanced navigation strategies.

3. **Incremental Testing:** Test each section of the form individually to isolate and fix issues.

4. **Full Process Validation:** Once all sections are working individually, test the complete process end-to-end.

## Attachments

The following evidence has been collected and packaged into `dmce_automation_evidence.tar.gz`:

- **Screenshots:** 28 screenshots capturing various stages and errors
- **Videos:** 38 video recordings of the automation process
- **Trace:** Complete Playwright trace file (69.7 MB)
- **Test Report:** Detailed test report with findings and recommendations

## Conclusion

The DMCE portal automation script successfully handles the login process and dashboard navigation but encounters issues with form field selectors. With the recommended improvements, the script can be enhanced to successfully automate the complete DMCE declaration process.

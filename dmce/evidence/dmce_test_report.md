## Evidence Collected

- **Screenshots:** 28 screenshots capturing various stages and errors
- **Videos:** 38 video recordings of the automation process
- **Trace:** Complete Playwright trace file (69.7 MB)

## Key Findings

1. **Login Process:** Works correctly with provided credentials
2. **Dashboard Navigation:** Successfully loads but requires longer timeouts
3. **Menu Navigation:** Standard selectors not working, requiring JavaScript evaluation and coordinate clicks
4. **Form Fields:** Expected selectors (#inputFactura, etc.) not found in the form

## Selector Issues

The script encountered the following selector issues:

1. **Form Selector:** Expected `#crearDeclaracionForm` but found generic `form` element
2. **Invoice ID Field:** Timeout when trying to locate `#inputFactura`
3. **Declaration Date Field:** Timeout when trying to locate `#inputFechaDeclaracion`
4. **Customer Code Field:** Timeout when trying to locate `#inputCliente`

## Recommendations

1. **Update Selectors:** Analyze the form structure in screenshots to identify correct selectors
2. **Increase Timeouts:** Extend timeouts for dashboard and form loading
3. **Enhance Fallback Mechanisms:** Add more robust fallback methods for element location
4. **Implement Iframe Handling:** Add specific iframe navigation if form is within iframe
5. **Add Debug Logging:** Add more detailed logging of DOM structure for debugging

## Next Steps

1. Analyze screenshots and trace file to identify correct selectors
2. Update script with correct selectors and enhanced fallback mechanisms
3. Re-run test with updated script
4. Collect and analyze new evidence

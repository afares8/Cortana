# DMCE Portal Manual Login Verification Report

## Login Credentials Verification
- Username: crandonzlpr
- Password: perfumes
- Status: âœ… SUCCESSFUL

## Hidden Form Fields Identified
The following hidden form fields were extracted from the login form:
1. language
2. _csrf (CSRF token)
3. j_f
4. j_s
5. j_nath

These fields must be included in the form submission for successful authentication.

## Login Process Details
1. Initial URL: https://dmce2.zonalibredecolon.gob.pa/TFBFTZ/cusLogin/login.cl?language=es
2. Popup URL: https://dmce2.zonalibredecolon.gob.pa/TFBFTZ/cusLogin/signin.cl?language=es
3. Form submission endpoint: https://dmce2.zonalibredecolon.gob.pa/TFBFTZ/j_spring_security_check_ftz_form
4. Post-login URL: https://dmce2.zonalibredecolon.gob.pa/TFBFTZ/TFB.jsp?language=es

## Authentication Flow
1. The login form is submitted via POST to j_spring_security_check_ftz_form
2. Server responds with 302 redirect upon successful authentication
3. Client is redirected to TFB.jsp dashboard page

## Dashboard Loading Behavior
- The dashboard uses a complex loading process with multiple JavaScript resources
- The body element remains hidden during loading (detected 45 times as hidden)
- Multiple API calls are made after login (IDACall and remote_logging endpoints)
- Dashboard uses SmartClient framework (ISC modules)

## Recommendations for Script Updates
1. Include all hidden form fields in authentication request
2. Use programmatic form submission instead of simple click
3. Implement longer timeouts for dashboard loading (>20 seconds)
4. Consider alternative selectors for detecting dashboard readiness
5. Explore menu structure to find invoice-related functionality

This verification confirms that the provided credentials work correctly and identifies the necessary form fields and authentication flow for successful automation.

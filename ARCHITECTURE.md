# LegalContractTracker Microservice Architecture

## Overview

This document outlines the modular microservice architecture for the LegalContractTracker application. The architecture is designed to support the legal department of the Zona Libre de Col√≥n perfumery business, with a focus on scalability, maintainability, and future integration with other departments.

## Architecture Principles

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Each service has a clearly defined responsibility
2. **API Contracts**: Services communicate through well-defined API contracts
3. **Independent Deployment**: Services can be deployed independently
4. **Data Ownership**: Each service owns its data and exposes it through APIs
5. **Resilience**: Services are designed to handle failures gracefully
6. **Security**: All services implement appropriate security measures
7. **Observability**: Services provide monitoring, logging, and tracing capabilities

## Microservice Boundaries

The application is divided into the following microservices:

### 1. Contracts Service

**Responsibility**: Manages contract lifecycle, versioning, and document storage

**Key Features**:
- Contract CRUD operations
- Version history management
- Document storage and retrieval
- E-signature integration
- Contract expiration tracking

**API Endpoints**:
- `/api/v1/contracts/*` - Contract management endpoints
- `/api/v1/contracts/{id}/versions/*` - Version management endpoints
- `/api/v1/contracts/{id}/documents/*` - Document management endpoints

**Data Models**:
- `Contract`
- `ContractVersion`
- `ContractDocument`

### 2. Clients/Providers Service

**Responsibility**: Manages legal entity data, KYC documents, and client relationships

**Key Features**:
- Client/Provider CRUD operations
- KYC document management

- Client relationship tracking

**API Endpoints**:
- `/api/v1/clients/*` - Client management endpoints
- `/api/v1/providers/*` - Provider management endpoints
- `/api/v1/clients/{id}/documents/*` - Client document management endpoints

**Data Models**:
- `Client`
- `Provider`
- `ClientDocument`
- `ProviderDocument`

### 3. Compliance Service

**Responsibility**: Handles regulatory compliance, UAF reports, and PEP/sanctions screening

**Key Features**:
- UAF report generation

- Compliance check automation

**API Endpoints**:
- `/api/v1/compliance/reports/*` - Compliance report endpoints
- `/api/v1/compliance/checks/*` - Compliance check endpoints
- `/api/v1/compliance/screening/*` - PEP/sanctions screening endpoints

**Data Models**:
- `ComplianceReport`
- `ComplianceCheck`
- `PEPScreeningResult`
- `SanctionsScreeningResult`

### 4. Workflow Service

**Responsibility**: Manages approval workflow templates and instances

**Key Features**:
- Workflow template management
- Workflow instance creation and tracking
- Step approval/rejection
- Notification integration

**API Endpoints**:
- `/api/v1/workflows/templates/*` - Workflow template endpoints
- `/api/v1/workflows/instances/*` - Workflow instance endpoints
- `/api/v1/workflows/instances/{id}/steps/*` - Workflow step endpoints

**Data Models**:
- `WorkflowTemplate`
- `WorkflowInstance`
- `WorkflowStep`

### 5. Tasks Service

**Responsibility**: Manages tasks and reminders with cross-module integration

**Key Features**:
- Task creation and assignment
- Reminder scheduling
- Task status tracking
- Cross-module task integration

**API Endpoints**:
- `/api/v1/tasks/*` - Task management endpoints
- `/api/v1/tasks/reminders/*` - Reminder management endpoints

**Data Models**:
- `Task`
- `Reminder`
- `TaskAssignment`

### 6. Audit Service

**Responsibility**: Centralizes logging of user actions and system events

**Key Features**:
- User action logging
- System event logging
- Audit trail generation
- Compliance reporting

**API Endpoints**:
- `/api/v1/audit/logs/*` - Audit log endpoints
- `/api/v1/audit/reports/*` - Audit report endpoints

**Data Models**:
- `AuditLog`
- `AuditReport`

### 7. AI Service

**Responsibility**: Provides endpoints for AI analysis and document processing

**Key Features**:
- Contract clause extraction
- Risk scoring
- Document summarization
- Natural language querying
- Spanish language support

**API Endpoints**:
- `/api/v1/ai/analyze/*` - Document analysis endpoints
- `/api/v1/ai/extract/*` - Clause extraction endpoints
- `/api/v1/ai/query/*` - Natural language query endpoints
- `/api/v1/ai/mistral/*` - Mistral model endpoints

**Data Models**:
- `AIAnalysisResult`
- `ExtractedClause`
- `RiskScore`
- `AIQuery`

## Service Communication

Services communicate through:

1. **Synchronous REST APIs**: For direct service-to-service communication
2. **Asynchronous Events**: For event-driven communication (future implementation)
3. **Shared Database Access**: Limited to specific use cases where necessary

## Implementation Approach

The implementation will follow these steps:

1. **Phase 1**: Refactor existing code into service modules without changing functionality
2. **Phase 2**: Implement proper API contracts between services
3. **Phase 3**: Implement database isolation for each service
4. **Phase 4**: Implement proper error handling and resilience patterns
5. **Phase 5**: Implement observability and monitoring

## Deployment Strategy

Each service will be deployable as:

1. **Monolithic Deployment**: All services deployed together (development/testing)
2. **Microservice Deployment**: Services deployed independently (production)

## Security Considerations

1. **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication shared across services
2. **Authorization**: Role-based access control implemented at each service
3. **Data Protection**: Encryption at rest and in transit
4. **API Security**: Rate limiting, input validation, and OWASP protection

## Future Extensions

The architecture is designed to support future extensions:

1. **Integration with Accounting Department**
2. **Integration with HR Department**
3. **Integration with Procurement Department**
4. **Mobile Application Support**
5. **Advanced Analytics and Reporting**
